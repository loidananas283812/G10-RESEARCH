									<p>A flood is an overflow of water onto normally dry land, often caused by heavy rainfall. To prevent the damages caused by floods, whether it be property or human lives, preparedness is of utmost importance of doing so.</p>

									<h2>BEFORE A FLOOD:</h2>
									<p>1. Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a family emergency plan that includes evacuation routes, assembly points, and communication methods. Ensure all family members are aware of the plan.</p>
									<p>2. Secure Important Documents: Safeguard important documents like identification papers, insurance policies, and medical records in a waterproof and easily accessible container. Consider keeping digital copies as well.</p>
									<p>3. Elevate and waterproof your personal belongings: Raise electrical systems, appliances, and valuable items above potential flood levels. Install waterproof barriers or seals for doors, windows, and basement entry points.</p>
									<p>4. Have emergency supplies on hand: Assemble an emergency kit including non-perishable food, drinking water, medications, first aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, blankets, and a battery-operated radio. Store the kit in a readily accessible location.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>DURING A FLOOD:</h2>
									<p>1. Move to Higher Ground: Seek higher ground such as hills and mountains and avoid low-lying areas prone to flooding. If trapped in a building, do not exit and move to the highest story available.</p>
									<p>2. Unplug all Electric Devices: During a flood, it is advised to unplug all electronic devices to reduce the risk of electrocution and short circuits.</p>
									<p>3. Stay Informed: Listen to local news and emergency broadcasts for updates and instructions. Keep your mobile phone charged and your radio be on standby for communication purposes.</p>
									<p>4. Stay away from floodwater: Avoid walking or driving through floodwaters, as they may be deeper or swifter than they appear, increasing the risk of bodily harm. Even a 6 inch deep flood is enough to sweep your legs and knock you off balance.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>AFTER A FLOOD:</h2>
									<p>1. Check for Damage: Inspect your property for any chemical or gas leaks when you return, use caution when navigating the property as the ground might be still wet, slippery, or laced with leaked chemicals.</p>
									<p>2. Thoroughly clean and disinfect the entire property: Thoroughly clean and disinfect your property after a flood. Wear protective gear, and use suitable cleaning agents to prevent mold and remove contaminants.</p>
									<p>3. Consult Professionals for repairs: Call your local services in cases of structural inspections, electrical system repairs, or water and sewage piping damage restoration if needed.</p>
