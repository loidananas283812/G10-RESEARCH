									<p>Landslides, are nature's unstoppable force of gravity, capable of reshaping the terrain we walk on in an instant. However, there are no dangers from nature we can't prepare against. It's incredible how quickly they can strike, transforming landscapes, tearing down homes, and tragically claiming lives. which is why it is absolutely vital to prepare ourselves against the potential devastation caused by landslides.</p>

									<h2>If indoors</h2>
									<p>Find cover in the section of the building that is furthest away from the approaching landslide.</p>
									<p>Take shelter under a strong table or bench.</p>
									<p>Hold on firmly and stay put until all movement has ceased.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>If outdoors</h2>
									<p>Move quickly away from its likely path, keeping clear of embankments, trees, power lines and poles.</p>
									<p>Stay away from the landslide. The slope may experience additional failures for hours to days afterwards.</p>
