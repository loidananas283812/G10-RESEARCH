									<h2>WHAT IS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS?</h2>
									<p>Disaster preparedness is a broad approach that includes a variety of strategies, plans, and actions taken to reduce the risks and negative effects of disasters. It aims to improve individuals', communities', organizations', and governments' ability to respond to and recover from natural disasters.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4 reasons why Disaster Preparedness is important</h2>
									<p>1. Preparing saves Lives: Natural disasters can have devastating impacts on human life. Preparedness measures, such as early warning systems, evacuation plans, and emergency response training, can help save lives by enabling timely and efficient evacuation, search and rescue operations, and medical assistance.</p>
									<p>2. Minimizes Injuries and Trauma: Being prepared for natural disasters reduces the risk of injuries and trauma. Preparedness includes educating individuals on safety procedures, providing proper equipment and resources, and promoting awareness of potential hazards. This knowledge equips people to respond appropriately and minimize harm to themselves and others.</p>
									<p>3.Reducing Property Damage: Natural disasters can cause significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. Preparedness efforts, such as implementing building codes, reinforcing structures, and conducting risk assessments, can help mitigate the impact of disasters and reduce property damage. This saves resources and facilitates a faster recovery process.</p>
									<p>4. Enhancing Resilience: Prepared communities are more resilient in the face of natural disasters. By investing in preparedness, communities can strengthen their capacity to withstand and recover from disasters. This includes establishing networks, coordinating resources, and fostering community cohesion, all of which contribute to a quicker and more effective recovery.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<p>It is essential to adapt disaster preparedness plans to the specific risks and characteristics of your region. Stay informed, collaborate with local authorities, and engage in community preparedness efforts. Which is why preparedness truly starts at the individual level.</p>
