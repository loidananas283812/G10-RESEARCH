									<h2>BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE:</h2>
									<p>1. Create an Emergency Plan: Develop a family emergency plan that includes communication strategies, meeting points, and designated roles for each family member. Practice the plan regularly.</p>
									<p>2. Secure Heavy Objects: Anchor heavy furniture, appliances, and objects to prevent them from falling and causing injuries during an earthquake.</p>
									<p>3. Conduct a Home Safety Check: Identify potential hazards in your home, such as loose wiring or unsecured water heaters, and address them to reduce risks during an earthquake.</p>
									<p>4. Prepare an Emergency Kit: Assemble an emergency supply kit that includes essential items like food, water, medications, first aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, and important documents. Store it in a readily accessible location.</p>
									<p>5. Educate Yourself: Learn about earthquake safety and response procedures. Understand how to "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" during an earthquake to protect yourself from falling objects and debris.</p>

									<h2>DURING THE EARTHQUAKE:</h2>
									<p>1. Drop, Cover, and Hold On: When an earthquake occurs, drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops. Stay away from windows, heavy furniture that could topple, and objects that may fall.</p>
									<p>2. Stay Indoors: If you are indoors, do not attempt to run outside during the shaking. Falling debris and collapsing structures pose significant risks. Stay where you are until it is safe to move.</p>
									<p>3. Protect Your Head: If you are unable to take cover under furniture, protect your head and neck with your arms and seek shelter against an interior wall away from windows.</p>

									<h2>AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE:</h2>
									<p>1. Check for Injuries: Assess yourself and others for injuries. Provide first aid as necessary and seek medical assistance for serious injuries.</p>
									<p>2. Be Aware of Aftershocks: Aftershocks often follow the main earthquake. Be prepared for further shaking and take precautions to avoid hazards caused by structural damage or falling debris.</p>
									<p>3. Inspect Your Surroundings: Check for hazards such as gas leaks, downed power lines, or damaged structures. Evacuate if necessary and follow instructions from local authorities.</p>
									<p>4. Communicate and Seek Assistance: Use text messages or social media to communicate, as these channels are often more reliable during emergencies. Contact emergency services if needed and notify your loved ones about your safety.</p>
									<p>5. Document Damage: Take photographs or videos of any damage to your property for insurance claims. Keep records of any necessary repairs or expenses incurred.</p>
