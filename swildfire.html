									<h2>What to do when a fire occurs?</h2>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>1. React!</h2>
									<p>Drop everything as soon as you hear the fire alarm and head for the closest exit. If you're at home, find a safe place for you and your family. You might have just seconds to flee a burning building. If a fire breaks out at your house late at night, shout to let your neighbors know.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>2. Check the door</h2>
									<p>Check if there is smoke coming from under the door or if the door is hot to touch. If the door is cool to touch, open it slowly and pass. If not, keep it closed and stay in the room. Place wet towels on the gaps to prevent fire and smoke from coming in. Have someone pop out of a window and wave something bright, like a flashlight or a brightly-colored cloth, to signal for help. Once out of the room, use your buildingâ€™s emergency exit and evacuate immediately without panic.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. P.A.S.S. (Pull-Aim-Squeeze-Sweep) for Fire Extinguishers.</h2>
									<p>To use a fire extinguisher, first Pull the pin in the handle. Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire. Squeeze the lever slowly and Sweep from side to side. Use a fire extinguisher if and only if it is within reach, and only to put out small fires.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. Stop, Drop, and Roll</h2>
									<p>If your clothes caught fire, do not panic or touch the flame as it could only spread the fire. Stop moving, Drop on the ground, and Roll around until the fire is put out. Doing this will lessen injuries and put out the fire as quickly as possible.</p>
